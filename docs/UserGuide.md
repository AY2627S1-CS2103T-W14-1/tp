# CampusContacts User Guide

CampusContacts is a desktop application for managing contacts in the university community, optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, CampusContacts can help you manage contacts faster than traditional GUI applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure that Java `25` or later is installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for CampusContacts.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` to the folder containing the JAR file, and run `java -jar campuscontacts.jar`.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, type **`help`** and press Enter to open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add John Doe /email johnd@example.com /phone 98765432 /location John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to CampusContacts.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  For example, in `add NAME /email EMAIL /phone PHONE /location LOCATION`, replace `NAME` with `John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  For example, `[t/TAG]` means that a tag such as `t/friend` may be supplied or omitted.

* Items followed by `...` can appear zero or more times.<br>
  For example, `[t/TAG]... ` may be omitted, or written as `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`.

* Prefixed fields can be in any order. For `add`, the name must come before all prefixed fields.<br>
  For example, `add John Doe /phone 98765432 /location COM1 /email johnd@example.com` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that take no parameters, such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, are ignored.<br>
  For example, `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help: `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the contact list.

Format: `add NAME /email EMAIL /phone PHONE /location LOCATION [t/TAG]...`

* The name, email, phone number, and location are all required and must not be blank.
* Write the name first, without an `n/` prefix. The remaining fields may appear in any order.
* Separate `/email`, `/phone`, and `/location` from their values with a space.
* Each of these three prefixes must appear exactly once; repeated prefixes are rejected, even with identical values.
* Location is stored in the existing address field. It may contain spaces and punctuation.
* Tags remain optional and use the existing `t/TAG` syntax. The `edit` command retains its existing syntax.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags, including zero.
</box>

Examples:
* `add John Doe /email johnd@example.com /phone 98765432 /location COM1, #02-01`
* `add Betsy Crowe /location COM2 /phone 1234567 /email betsycrowe@example.com t/friend`

### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the contact list.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the contact list.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]... `

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, all of the person's existing tags are removed; adding tags is not cumulative.
* To remove all of a person's tags, enter `t/` without a tag after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive; for example, `hans` matches `Hans`.
* Keyword order does not matter; for example, `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`.
* The search considers only names.
* Only full words match; for example, `Han` does not match `Hans`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword are returned (an `OR` search); for example, `Hans Bo` returns `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>

### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the contact list.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the contact list.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the contact list.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

CampusContacts automatically saves data after every command. You do not need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

CampusContacts data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/campuscontacts.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes make the data file invalid, CampusContacts starts with an empty contact list at the next run. The invalid file remains on disk until you run a command (CampusContacts saves after every command). Still, we recommend backing up the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the CampusContacts to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the data file it creates with the data file from your previous CampusContacts home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
